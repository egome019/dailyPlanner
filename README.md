# Daily Planner

This application is a daily work day planner. It has time blocks from 9am to 5pm and depending on the time they will either be greyed out because the time for that specific block has passed, it will be red for current time, or green for a time that is in the future. When you pick a time and add text to the time block and click save the text will be saved to the time block and will persist even when the page is refreshed.

This application uses:
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>BootStrap CSS</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>jQuery</li>
  <li>Manipulation of Moment.js database</li>
</ul>

Below is a snippet of how the application works:
